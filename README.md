Game Mechanics
Energy Management: The fish has an energy bar that decreases when charging for a speed boost. Energy can be replenished over time but will run out if continuously charged.
Obstacles: The game features randomly generated obstacles (gears) that move horizontally across the screen. The player must avoid colliding with them to survive.
Flapping: The player can flap the fish upwards by pressing Space or Enter. The fish's speed is affected by gravity and the player's energy.
