Project Overview
The Flappy Fish game is a simple 2D game where a player controls a fish character and must avoid obstacles. The objective is to navigate through an endless series of moving obstacles while avoiding collisions and managing the fish's energy.

The player can charge energy for a temporary speed boost and flap to ascend, mimicking the gameplay mechanics of the classic Flappy Bird game but with a unique aquatic theme.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the game's content and interface.
CSS3: For styling the canvas and ensuring responsiveness.
JavaScript: For handling game logic, animations, and event-driven actions.
Canvas API: For rendering the gameâ€™s graphical elements.
Audio: For background music and sound effects during gameplay.
Features
Player Character: A fish that can flap to rise and move through obstacles.
Obstacles: Moving objects that the player must avoid to continue playing.
Energy Mechanics: The player can charge energy to temporarily boost speed.
Responsive Design: The game adapts to different screen sizes.
Sound Effects: Includes sound effects for actions like flapping and collisions.
Game Over Screen: Displays a message when the player collides with an obstacle, along with the time taken.
Score and Timer: Shows the player's current score and time survived.
Mobile-Friendly: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices, with touch controls.
Game Instructions
Starting the Game:
Click on the canvas or press Space to start the game.
You can use the mouse or keyboard (Space or Enter) to flap and move the fish.
Player Controls:
Flap: Click the canvas or press the Space or Enter key to flap the fish.
Charge Energy: Press and hold the Shift or C key to charge energy.
Objective:
The goal is to avoid obstacles while maintaining energy levels and making it through as many obstacles as possible.
End of Game:
If you collide with an obstacle, the game ends, and a message will be displayed showing the time you survived.
Restarting the Game:
Press R to restart the game after a game-over.
Setup and Installation
To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-fish.git
2. Navigate to the Project Folder:
bash
Copy code
cd flappy-fish
3. Open index.html:
Open the index.html file in your browser to start playing the game.
4. Installing Dependencies:
If using additional libraries, install dependencies (not necessary for this specific project, as it's pure HTML, CSS, and JS).
5. Run the Game:
After opening index.html, the game should load in your browser.
Game Mechanics
Player Mechanics:

The player controls the fish's movements using flapping and energy charging. The fish moves downward automatically due to gravity and can rise by flapping. Energy is needed for a speed boost when charging.
Obstacle Mechanics:

Obstacles (gears) move across the screen from right to left. If the fish collides with an obstacle, the game ends.
Obstacles are randomly positioned along the Y-axis.
Energy Mechanics:

The fish has an energy bar that regenerates over time and drains when charging. If the energy reaches 0, charging stops.
The energy affects the fish's speed, and the fish can charge to boost speed.
Game Over Condition:

A collision with an obstacle triggers the game over screen, showing the time survived and providing an option to restart.
